<p>I don't want to go back to work. This trip has been so {{ magical }}. I've mostly been hanging out at {{ foursq venue }}. It's pretty {{ cool }}.</p>

<p>And I've been eating loads of {{ wikisplash place cuisine }}. {{ photos }}</p>

<p>Being here makes me worry a bit about what I'm doing with my life. That {{ deadline }} is still going to be there when I get back. I know you shouldn't make {{ major life decisions }} while on holiday, but I've got a lot of thinking to do.</p>
