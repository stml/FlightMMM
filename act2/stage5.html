<p>OK, I was wrong about the only good thing about flying. About {{ half way through }} the flight, I looked out of the window, and even though it was {{ cloudy }} I could see this incredible landscape. </p>

<p>So beautiful.</p>

<p>I love {{ this view }}. The {{ round window and the wing }}. I used to be {{ scared of flying }} but not any more. I feel {{ weightless }} when I'm going on holiday. I know nothing bad could ever happen.</p>
