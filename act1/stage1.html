<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;I want to go away again. I was listening to {{ Tune }} and it always gives me itchy feet. I haven't been away in years and sometimes it all gets &lt;a bit much&gt;. &lt;Same thing, day after day, tube, work, dinner, work, tube, armchair, sleep, tube, work. How much more can you take? One in ten go mad. One in five cracks up.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

Some friends had been to &lt;place&gt; and said it was pretty special, so I thought - fuck it. I bought a ticket on Easyjet and I'm going next week.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
