<p>I want to go away again. I was listening to {{ Tune }} and it always gives me itchy feet. I haven't been away in years and sometimes it all gets <a bit much>. <Same thing, day after day, tube, work, dinner, work, tube, armchair, sleep, tube, work. How much more can you take? One in ten go mad. One in five cracks up.</p>

<p>I went on <online travel site / network - dopplr?>  and had a poke about. Some friends had been to <place> and said it was pretty special, so I thought - fuck it. I bought a ticket on Easyjet and I'm going next week.</p>

<p>Nothing like a snap decision.</p>
