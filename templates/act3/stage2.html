<p>Had to get a {{ FlightTransport }} back to the airport. So depressing. And the roads here are awful, so it took ages. We stopped off at {{ HolidayHangout }} one last time, and said goodbye to everyone. They were playing {{ HolidayTune.Name }} AGAIN, which is like the anthem of the holiday. It will always remind of this place.</p>
