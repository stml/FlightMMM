<p>Christ, {{ boss }} is saying I can't go. Something about the new {{ deadlines }} on the {{ job }}. I'm pretty pissed off about this - I'd just got to that really excited, I've-got-a-ticket-in-my-pocket phase.</p>

<p>If I don't go now, I won't go. I know it. I mean, check out these photos of {{ place }}. I'm going to cry if I can't go.</p>
